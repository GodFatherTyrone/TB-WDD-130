                <div class="questions">
                    <h4>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h4>
                    <p>I was able to come up with the Design for my webpage Because Starwars has always been an intrest of mine. But resently i was ablt to get my wifer into it and we have been talking ablout the changes to the lore together. So it was on my mind for this project.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h4>
                    <p>I was able to hand off my site plan by email. I have not gotten any information about the project back. I emailed Jonathan Harsch (My Lead Developer) on Dec 5th to see if I could see the page and got no responce.(now is Dec 13th)</p>

                    <h4>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h4>
                    <p>I have no Idea, I have not been able to see the page.</p>

                    <h4>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h4>
                    <p>I would probubly hire someone who would send the link or files to me so I can see what he's worked on.</p>

                    <h4>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h4>
                    <p>I set up a team chat on Microsoft Teams and was able to corrdinat with my Jr Dev in that chat. I assigned pages by asking what he wanted and choosing together. Although I never was able to get in contact with Alexander Pehrson.</p>

                    <h4>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h4>
                    <p>I was able to communicate with my client through email. We discussed what pictures he wanted. For whatever reason he never opened teams.</p>

                    <h4>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h4>
                    <p>I was able to share the link in Teams to the whole team (Including the client). But when I relized that he was never going to check Teams, I emailed it to him.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h4>
                    <p>Github is a wondrous website that ive had expirence with in the past. I was able to use it to great effect with our projects and throughout the class.</p>

                    <h4>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h4>
                    <p>Johnathan Harsch and Brayden Dawson did an amazing job at contacting me and letting me know what they want me to do. The only issue team 'Explore Rexburg' had was how the client was really late in getting us thier siteplan.</p>

                    <h4>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, in both cases I knew exactly what page I was to work on. Any questions I had were quickly answered or turned over to the client to get back to us.</p>

                    <h4>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h4>
                    <p>I was able to put the right information into the pages I was in charge of.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h4>
                    <p>I did not runn into any major issues. The only minor issue i ran into what when i tried to work on one of my pages without the index page being completly done first.</p>

                    <h4>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h4>
                    <p>I bealeve the most chalenging part was how slow comunication can be when everyone is busy witht differnt projects for differnt classes. As well as the none communication from specific student who never ended up working on the project.</p>

                    <h4>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h4>
                    <p>I enjoyed seeing the procces of how others think and how they layout their code. Comparing and learning from those differences was fun.</p>

                    <h4>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h4>
                    <p>If I were to do this project again i would try to meet with the lead or client first thing, to go over the over arching plan together. This would expidit the waiting for instruction that was present in this project.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h4>
                    <p>I do feel more confident in working on real-world projects. This expirence taught me how working with a client can be smooth if you are able to communicate effectivly with eachother.</p>
